# GW_task5
Jupyter notebook for task5

- run on Linux, since some package cannot install on Windows or it's hard to
- I don't really understand the difference between 'obs', 'clean' and 'noisefree', the reason why I chose 'noisefree' just simply because the result looks similar with the reference plot.
- The frequency range in the first plot is base on Nyquist law and time range of h5 file, while the second only show the reliable part of it which is in the same frequncy range of the reference plot.
- 4 verdical peak at day 7, 25, 30 & 30.5 looks agree with the reference
- **But the chirp signal around day 30 cannot be seen** I tried many methods, with little effect
- **And a strange horizontal signal appears in log f = -2.75, I cannot get rid of it**
- **Background noise in reference plot shows high amplitude in high freq zone while this work shows the opposite**
